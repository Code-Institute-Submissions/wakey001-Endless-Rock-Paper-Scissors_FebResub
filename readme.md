### Design choices


#### Fonts
Fonts for my website are from [GOOGLE FONTS](https://fonts.google.com/). I have decided to go with FONT HERE as I feel in my opinion this is a modern and current feel and is easy to read.I also chose the same for my header as I feel this contasts well with the main text as when larger its flair is even more noticabe in my opinion.
#### Icons
 Icons for my website are from [FONT AWESOME LIBRARY](https://fontawesome.com/).The icons I have chosen are in fitting with the game type as they provide a little fun whilst giving a visual cue whilst also making the site feel modern and for a young audience.
