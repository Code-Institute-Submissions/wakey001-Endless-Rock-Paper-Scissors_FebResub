  ![Header image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83303996/139601360-22c47825-6ea2-4cf4-bb6e-90332b88d1ef.PNG)

    
  * The Game Choices
    * The game includes clear instructions in the footer and a clear choice of buttons to push. These are rock, paper or scissors and are interactive that the user clicks. These have the styled to give a 3d effect when hovered over as well as the cursor transforming to a pointer.

    ![Interactive Buttons](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83303996/139327196-08eec25b-186a-4ab5-8df1-b8d3a48ceafb.PNG)

    * The winner and scoreboard are clear for the user to understand.

  * Player and computer Images
    * These have a standard image with a battle stance that is mirrored for the computer, this gives the game a playful but serious feel.

 * Features To Be Implemented
    * In the future Id like to add the Lizard Spock from the big bang theory.
    * Id also like to add an end game feature which ends the game after either player or computer wins 5 or 10 games 
    * I'd also potentially like to have a countdown with audio " 3.. 2.. 1.. Draw!", this would add more tension and excitement to the game.

### Design choices

#### Fonts
* Fonts for my website are from [GOOGLE FONTS](https://fonts.google.com/). I have decided to go with [Simonetta](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Simonetta?preview.text=Rock%20Paper%20Scissors&preview.text_type=custom&query=ox) as I feel in my opinion this is a modern and stylish and current feel and is easy to read. I also chose the same for my header as I feel this contrasts well with the main text as when larger its flair is even more noticeable in my opinion.
I have also gone with [Irish Grover](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Irish+Grover?preview.text=Rock%20Paper%20Scissors&preview.text_type=custom) 
* I've gone with this as it's a bit wacky and out there and I wanted to give the game a cool looking but readable font.

#### Icons
* Icons for my website are from [FONT AWESOME LIBRARY](https://fontawesome.com/).The icons I have chosen are :
[Rock](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/hand-rock?style=solid)
[Paper](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/hand-paper?style=solid)
[Scissors](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/hand-scissors?style=solid)

* These fit with the game type as they provide a little fun whilst giving a visual cue whilst also making the site feel modern and for a young audience.

### Wireframes
* To design the wireframes I have used [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/). These designs vary depending on screen size.

![Mobile Wireframe]()

![Tablet Wireframe]()

![Desktop Wireframe]()


### Images
* All of my images are borrowed from google images and mirrored using the site [onlinepngtools](https://onlinepngtools.com/flip-png-horizontally).

### Structure
* I will be building my website with a mobile-first approach. Using the Chrome developer tools to give me the iPhone 5/SE (320px), I will use this as the smallest screen size for styling. The only media query I've needed to make in CSS is for screens under 500px.

### Testing 
* As this was my first attempt at JavaScript I have had to take a different approach to test, console.log is now my best friend. It has been challenging to say the least.
After some feedback from my mentor and friends, I decided to implement the player and computer weapon image successfully.
Another part of the game I would have liked to implement is an endgame function, as this was also given as feedback. At this time I do not know 100% how to implement this but hopefully can in the future.
As such, I decided to call the game endless rock-paper-scissors.

I have checked my code in all 3 of the recommended validator services without issue. These are mentioned below in tools.
 
* My results from the lighthouse in dev tools are below. With no errors in my CSS or HTML when passed through the validators mentioned in the tools section.

![Lighthouse Performance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83303996/138968391-2a535cac-70a4-40c8-aee7-32de647f0860.PNG)

#### Bugs

* ##### Bug 
  * An issue I came across was with my win() function being implemented. This function was to increment the score. The problem was the numbers on the scoreboard would say, NaN. 

* ##### Fix 
  * Could not figure out the problem so turned to slack for help. This put me in the direction of looking at what the values of my variables were which turned out to be the main problem. I had not declared that the variable for playerScore and computerScore needed to be 0. 

* ##### Verdict 
  * After the fix, I tested the game thoroughly to find It now works perfectly with the scoreboard working fluently.

#### Mobile device

* #### Bug 
  * When on smaller devices under 350px  , the div expands when scissors is chosen making one side lop-sided


* #### Fix 
  * I decided the best option was to decrease the font size using a media query for screens under 350px. I targeted divs with h2 headings and played around with different sizes before settling at 70%.

* ##### Verdict 
  * After implementing the fix the mobile devices under 350px now display constant sizes reliably and does not increase or decrease the size of the div.

#### images
* ##### Bug 
  * When uploading my images of rock paper scissors. They load vertically by default and were both to the left of their div containers. This looked terrible so needed to be fixed. 

*  ##### Fix
  * I fixed them in css using display:flex , flex-direction: column , and align-items: center .
  
 
* ##### Verdict
  * This made them sit perfectly in the middle of their div container whilst still retaining the vertical image layout.
 
### Unfixed Bugs
* The game works 100% of the time but there till is a slight glitch which at this time is still present whereby after clicking a button eg scissors sometimes it does not display the choice for the user, this is not the case for the computer and the scoreboard still operates as intended. I am hoping to iron this out before the deadline.![UserChoice Glitch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83303996/139594642-0dc976cb-eb2c-4edb-b97c-63c68f7aeade.PNG)

This has now been fixed. The issue was if you clicked on the Icon within the button It would not show the users choice as the icon had no value. This was fixed by giving the icon the same id as its corresponding button.

### Deployment
This project was deployed using Github using the following method:

1. After logging into github.com open repository
2. Click on settings then on the left find the pages section 
3. Once on the page click on the master branch and then save 
4. Now a link should appear and in a few moments be able to be clicked 
5. This is now a live website that can be viewed from any device

To run it locally on Gitpod follow this method:

1. Assuming you have Gitpod as an add on. Click on which repository you want to run.
2. Click on Gitpod this should then take a few moments 
3. Once loaded find the terminal section and type python3 -m HTTP.server
4. This will open a port 8000, click yes to open

### Credits
#### Content-Media-Inspiration
* My inspiration was a mixture of a lot of games I have seen both online on youtube and on the forum slack.

#### Images 
* The Images I obtained are from google images and flipped to get the mirror image for the computer side via [onlinepngtools](https://onlinepngtools.com/flip-png-horizontally) This site became a saviour of mine as its quick and easy. I'd spent a number of hours in paint flipping but losing transparency when doing so.
This is not the case with the website above.

#### Acknowledgements
* I'd like to firstly acknowledge my mentor [Simen Daehlin](https://github.com/Eventyret), his guidance helped me structure the project to meet deadlines for our meetings which helped immensely. I'd also like to thank the community of slack who helped me with some issues I had with JavaScript.
