 * Features To Be Implemented
    * In the future Id like to add the Lizard spock from the big bang theory.
    * Id also like to add an end game feature which ends the game after either player or computer wins 5 or 10 games 
    * I'd also potentially like to have a countdown with audio " 3.. 2.. 1.. Draw!" , this would add more tension and excitment to the game imo.

### Design choices


#### Fonts
* Fonts for my website are from [GOOGLE FONTS](https://fonts.google.com/). I have decided to go with [Simonetta](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Simonetta?preview.text=Rock%20Paper%20Scissors&preview.text_type=custom&query=ox) as I feel in my opinion this is a modern and stylish and current feel and is easy to read.I also chose the same for my header as I feel this contasts well with the main text as when larger its flair is even more noticabe in my opinion.
I have also gone with [Irish Grover](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Irish+Grover?preview.text=Rock%20Paper%20Scissors&preview.text_type=custom) 
* Ive gone with this as its a bit wacky and out there and I wanted to give the game a cool looking but readable font.

* Icons for my website are from [FONT AWESOME LIBRARY](https://fontawesome.com/).The icons I have chosen are :
[Rock](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/hand-rock?style=solid)

### Testing 

* My results from the lighthouse in devtools are below. With no errors in my CSS or HTML when passed through the validators mentioned in the tools section.


![Lighthouse Performance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83303996/138968391-2a535cac-70a4-40c8-aee7-32de647f0860.PNG)

#### Bugs

* ##### Bug 
  * An issue I came across was with my win() function being implemented . This fuction was to increment the score. The problem was the numbers on the score board would say NaN . 

 

* ##### Fix 
  * Could not figure out the problem so turned to slack for help . This put me in the direction of looking at what my variables values were which turned out to be the main problem . I had not declared that the variable for playerScore and computerScore needed to be 0 . 

* ##### Verdict 
  * After the fix I tested the game thouroughly to find It now works perfectly with the scoreboard working fluently.

#### Mobile device

* #### Bug 
  * When on smaller devices under 350px  , the div expands when scissors is chosen making one side lop-sided


* #### Fix 
  * I decided the best option was to decrease the font size using a media query for screens under 350px. I targeted divs with h2 headings and played around with different sizes before settling at 70% .

* ##### Verdict 
  * After implementing the fix the mobile devices under 350px now display constant sizes reliably and does not increase or decrease the size of the div.

#### images
* ##### Bug 
  * When uploading my images of rock paper scissors . They load vertically by default and were both to the left of there div containers. This looked terrible so neede to be fixed. 

*  ##### Fix
  * I fixed them in css using display:flex , flex-direction: column , and align-items: center .
  
 
* ##### Verdict
  * This made them sit perfect in the middle of their div container whilst still retaining the vertical image layout.

### Credits
#### Content-Media-Inspiration
* My inspiration was a mixture of codeinstitute, youtube two youtubers inparticular and my personal view on how I wanted it to look.

#### Images 
* The Images I obtained are from google images and flipped to get the mirror image for the comuter side via [onlinepngtools](https://onlinepngtools.com/flip-png-horizontally) This site became a saviour of mine as its quick and easy . I'd spent a number of hours in paint flipping but losing transparancy when doing so .
Which is not the case with the website above.

#### Acknowledgements
* I'd like to firstly acknowledge my mentor [Simen Daehlin](https://github.com/Eventyret) , his guidence helped me structure the project to meet deadlines for our meetings which helped immensley. Id also like to thank the members of slack who helped me with some issues I had .
